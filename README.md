Students preparing for elite competitive exams often study **12–14 hours daily**, sacrificing sleep, physical activity, and social interaction. This leads to:

-  **Chronic Burnout** – Intense academic and social pressure  
-  **Health Neglect** – Unhealthy eating habits and physical inactivity  
- **Mental Health Crisis** – Severe anxiety, emotional exhaustion, and in extreme cases, suicidal thoughts  

StudyFlow addresses these challenges with a **balanced, AI-driven academic + wellness system**.
